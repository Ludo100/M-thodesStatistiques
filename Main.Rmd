This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Import libraries
library("here") #pas encore utilisé
library("PerformanceAnalytics")
library("qrmdata")
library("quantmod")

#Download data of the FTSE 100 and take the first 50 stocks alphabetically
data("FTSE_const", package = "qrmdata")
stocks <- last(FTSE_const[,1:50], '4 year')
weekly_returns <- sapply(stocks,weeklyReturn)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
